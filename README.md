## Overview

Welcome to Tune.Observer, a powerful, open-source tool designed to aid musicians and music enthusiasts in learning more about the sounds that surround them. Built on the robust NextJS TypeScript framework, this tool uses the WebAudio API to access your browser's microphone input and identify elements of the soundscape, specifically:

- **Note**: Determine the musical note of a sound.
- **Pitch**: Analyze the frequency, or pitch, of a sound.
- **BPM (Beats Per Minute)**: Estimate the tempo of a piece of music in BPM.

By distilling the intricate world of sound into these digestible data points, Tune.Observer aims to bridge the gap between technology and music, providing you with a deeper understanding of the audio environment.
